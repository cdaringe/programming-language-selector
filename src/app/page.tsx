          <h3>What is this tool for?</h3>
          <p>
            This tool <code>score</code>s programming languages based on their
            characteristics. It tries to enhance the decision making process
            when selecting a programming language. The decision making process
            is enhanced by using quantitative data and qualitative data
            (re-encoded as quantative data) by taking a complex assessment and
            projecting it down into a single dimension--a scalar{" "}
            <code>score</code>. The higher the score, the more fit the language
            for your use case.

          <h3>Can I trust this? Are the values correct?</h3>
          <p>
            <b>
              No one can or should agree with every value in the underlying
              assessment data or model.
            </b>
            There are quattuordecillions of combinations of inputs that the
            assessment data could hold. If you agree with everything as it is in
            its current state, you are not critiquing or looking hard enough.
            Values in default assessment data and model are both objective and
            subjective, but mainly the latter. Experienced developers understand
            that software is art. The assessed values liberally reflect
            subjectively artful evaluations{" "}
            <b>with experience and practice driven</b> guidance. All persons
            have biases, but we commit to the best and of our abilities to
            minimize biases in the assessed values. This tool is meant to
            assist, not to condemn or promote any given tool. Absolute judgement
            and dogmatism are unwelcome. If you are using this tool to prove a
            point, you are using it wrong. Can you trust it? Sure. Should this
            tool alone form your judgements during decision making? No, it
            should not.

          <h3>Why is the model designed the way it is?</h3>
          <p>
            The model is known (at current time) to be
            primitive/low-sophistication. Nonetheless, I surmise it does a
            better job at evaluating PL fitness than the average-
            {"developerâ„¢'s"} gut feeling, given the breadth of weighted
            dimensions in the model. Want to improve it? Please send a GitHub
            issue with a very concise explanation of your proposal. I am biased
            towards the default model having a high signal:complexity ratio. If
            a better model could be done at high complexity, we can work on
            supporting remote model loading.

          <h3>
            I think the input parameters could be better. Can we change them?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Yes. Please send a GitHub issue with a very concise explanation of
            your proposal. The model should be as simple as possible at the
            known loss of model fidelity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Can we use a different model entirely?</h3>
          <p>
            Absolutely. The functionality is not yet baked in, but this should
            absolutely accept models as input, versus purely the default model.
            <code>score = f(model, langData, userValues)</code>

          <h3>I disagree with the model. Can we tune the values?</h3>
          <p>Sure! Send a PR. We reserve the right to reject suggestions.</p>

          <h3>
            When I do X, this says A is better than B. That is definitely not
            correct. Why?

          <p>
            There very well could be mis-modeling. Let us work to correct it.

            ownership to a counsel of informed experts. You must demonstrate
            experience, sympathy, empathy, and the pursuit of nirvana. I will
            check a sample of your comment history in public GitHub. You must,
            above all else, be demonstrably kind in your programming public life
            on GitHub.
